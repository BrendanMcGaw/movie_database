# About
The goal of this project is to create a full stack web application that allows users to create a database of movies with the added feature of reviews, where to watch, trailers and the ability to check actors and directors, and see a list of all the movies that they were involved in.

This full stack web application was made in order to learn the fundamentals of backend, frontend and database.

Current front-end example.

**Still under development**

Working on this project has allowed me to touch on Node, Express, PostgresSQL, Docker, Knex Query Builder, React, JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS. 
Giving me a brief view of a full stack development ennvironment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Currently the database and backend are hosted on docker locally. 

Will work towards live implementation.

With docker installed you should be able to run
### `docker-compose up --build` 
in order to build the backend and database in docker, from there you can start adding movies to the database.
