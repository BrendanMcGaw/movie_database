# About
The goal of this project is to create a full stack web application that allows users to create a database of movies with the added feature of reviews, where to watch, trailers and the ability to check actors and directors, and see a list of all the movies that they were involved in.

This full stack web application was made in order to learn the fundamentals of backend, frontend and database.


Working on this project has allowed me to touch on Node, Express, PostgresSQL, Docker, Knex Query Builder, React, JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS. 
Giving me a brief view of a full stack development ennvironment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Currently the database and backend are hosted on docker locally. 

Will work towards live implementation.

With docker installed you should be able to run
### `docker-compose up --build` 
in order to build the backend and database in docker, from there you can start adding movies to the database.
